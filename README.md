# 👋 Hi, I’m John

Senior **Product Designer (UX/UI)** and **Design Technologist**.  
I design interfaces and help build the systems behind them.

My work lives at the intersection of **UX, front-end, and design systems**.  
Less presentation, more products that actually work in production.

## 🧠 How I think

- UX doesn’t end in Figma  
- Interfaces are shaped by code decisions  
- Design must respect constraints: performance, accessibility, maintenance  
- Seniority is knowing *when* to simplify and *why*

## 🧩 What I work with

### UX / Product
- UX Research & usability testing  
- Information Architecture  
- Interface design & prototyping (Figma)  
- Design Systems (tokens, components, governance)

### Front-end
- UI-focused front-end development  
- Scalable component architecture  
- Strong collaboration with engineering teams

**Stack**

## 🧱 Background

Over **10 years** working with digital products,  
bridging **design, engineering, and business**.

I’ve worked both in product teams and as a freelancer,  
which shaped a strong sense of ownership, decision-making, and real-world impact.
